# Design Sprint Foundations

This is a one-month course available at [https://www.udacity.com/course/design-sprint-foundations--nd201](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-sprint-foundations--nd201)

## Timing

I registered in the very first offering of the course, March 2018.

## Directory Layout

Normally a design sprint lasts for 4 days.  Each day of the design sprint corresponds to one week (in real-time) in the 
Udacity course.
 
Here I made one directory for each week of the course.  There is an assignment each week.

## Links

My solution for Day 3's assignment was to create a prototype using the Marvel online tool.  The Day3Project subdirectory contains screenshots, but it is more fun to interact with the prototype directly via:   [https://marvelapp.com/cbe1eij/](https://marvelapp.com/cbe1eij)
