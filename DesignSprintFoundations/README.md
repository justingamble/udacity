# Design Sprint Foundations

This is a one-month course available at [https://www.udacity.com/course/design-sprint-foundations--nd201](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-sprint-foundations--nd201)

## Directory Layout

Normally a design sprint lasts for 4 days.  Each "day" of the design sprint has required outputs, and corresponds to one week of curriculum in the Udacity course.
 
Here I made one directory for each week of the Udacity course, with each directory containing my solution to the assignment for that material.

## Notes

*Day 3 Assignment (Prototype)*.  I created a prototype using the Marvel online tool.  The Day3Project subdirectory contains screenshots, but it is more fun to interact with the prototype directly via:   [https://marvelapp.com/cbe1eij/](https://marvelapp.com/cbe1eij)

*Day 4 Assignment (Summary Report)*.  The provided user feedback was more appropriate for the Ooup sample solution than the solution I'd been developing throughout the course.  For this reason, my summary report discusses the provided Ooup sample solution.
