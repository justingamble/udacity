# Design Sprint Foundations

This is a one-month course available at ["https://www.udacity.com/course/design-sprint-foundations--nd201"](https://www.udacity.com/course/design-sprint-foundations--nd201)

## Timing

I registered in the very first offering of the course, March 2018.

## Directory Layout

Normally a design sprint lasts for 4 days.  Each day of the design sprint corresponds to one week (in real-time) in the 
Udacity course.
 
Here I made one directory for each week of the course.  There is an assignment each week.
